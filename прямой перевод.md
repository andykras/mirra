Exercise 1. Body Relaxation
It's easy to remember the sequence of this exercise. Create a cool atmosphere in the room, with fresh air. Stay alone for 10-15 minutes. Just play some pleasant relaxation music. There are many channels that offer various music for meditations. Here are some of them that we like:

1. Lie down comfortably, close your eyes. Breathe slowly and calmly, your body is at rest.
2. Say to yourself: I feel my breathing, and when I feel that it is calm and even, I relax various parts of my body. I feel every part of my body, my consciousness is in every part of my body. I feel it relaxing.
3. I relax:
* forehead, eyelids, cheeks, chin, jaw.
* Then I relax:
* the hairy part of my head from my forehead to my neck, ears, neck muscles.
* I let the relaxation flow down to my shoulders and relax:
* shoulders, I let them drop down, upper part of the forearms, elbows and lower part of the forearms.
* I relax my back and muscles on each side of the spine, as if sinking into a soft mattress. I exhale slowly to release tension in my back.
* Now I relax the muscles of my buttocks and legs, starting from the hips, then knees, ankles and toes, all the way to the tips of my fingers. I feel the relaxation getting deeper.
* I free my mind from thoughts. I feel it pleasantly light, imagining that thoughts are waves around me that are moving away farther and farther... even farther... and disappear. Inside, a calm and pleasant silence is established.
* I think about my breathing. I'm aware of its rhythm, as if it's lulling me. I feel how my breathing accompanies my relaxation.
* I'm at peace and begin to listen to myself. I'm aware of everything that's happening, everything that's felt inside, good well-being and silence.
* I slowly become aware of the room I'm in, my body, its limbs, and slowly start to move my legs and arms.
* I take a few deep breaths and open my eyes.
* Imagine a calming light that envelops you and helps you relax.
* Take a break before "leaving" the exercise, and try not to let anything bother you during this exit, when consciousness gradually returns to reality. Remember that levels of consciousness are characterized by descent and slow ascent.
* If this still happened, maintain your body position, close your eyes, and breathe slowly and evenly until you reach inner peace.

Exercise 2. Self-awareness
Learn to listen to everything that happens inside, on the level of our thoughts and feelings.
This practice will teach you to focus on one thought and the position of the body, which will help you become self-aware. Inner peace, attention, and concentration come with training. Everyone is capable of achieving this. Perform this exercise throughout the day. And no matter how busy we are, we can think and act consciously and be fully present in the moment. This makes our tasks and activities interesting, and we fulfill them more fully and joyfully. As a result, the main bonus of this practice is the art of living.
1. I take a comfortable position and close my eyes.
2. Slowly inhale, imagining and feeling my body and its position in space.
3. I feel my breathing and its rhythm, the movement of air in the chest, and concentrate on breathing while remaining in a relaxed state.
4. I observe this process.
5. When a thought arises, I focus on breathing. I allow thoughts to calmly leave, without internal irritation.
6. I remain in this state as long as I want.
7. Then I gradually return to my body, to the room where I am, gently moving my arms and legs.
8. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open my eyes.
