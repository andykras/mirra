Follow these steps for relaxation:
1. Lie down comfortably and close your eyes.
2. Breathe slowly and calmly, allowing your body to relax.
3. Repeat to yourself: "I feel my breathing, and when I feel that it is calm and even, I relax various parts of my body." Focus on every part of your body, and feel it relaxing. Begin by relaxing your forehead, eyelids, cheeks, chin, and jaw.
4. Relax the hairy part of your head, your ears, and your neck muscles.
5. Allow the relaxation to flow down to your shoulders, and then let them drop down. Relax the upper part of your forearms, elbows, and lower part of your forearms.
6. Relax the muscles on each side of your spine, sinking into a soft mattress. Exhale slowly to release tension in your back.
7. Relax the muscles of your buttocks and legs, starting from your hips, then your knees, ankles, toes, all the way to the tips of your fingers. Feel the relaxation getting deeper.
8. Free your mind from thoughts, feel it pleasantly light. Imagine that thoughts are waves around you that are moving away farther and farther, even farther until they disappear. Inside, a calm and pleasant silence is established.
9. Think about your breathing. Be aware of its rhythm, as if it's lulling you. Feel how your breathing accompanies your relaxation.
10. Be at peace and begin to listen to yourself. Be aware of everything that's happening, everything that's felt inside, good well-being, and silence.
11. Slowly become aware of the room you're in, your body, and its limbs. Start to move your legs and arms gently.
12. Take a few deep breaths and open your eyes. Imagine a calming light that envelops you and helps you relax.
13. Take a break before "leaving" the exercise and try not to let anything bother you during this exit, as consciousness gradually returns to reality. Remember that levels of consciousness are characterized by descent and slow ascent. If this doesn't happen, maintain your body position, close your eyes, and breathe slowly and evenly until you reach inner peace.

Exercise 2: Self-Awareness

To achieve self-awareness, learn to listen to everything that happens inside on the level of your thoughts and feelings. This practice will teach you to focus on one thought and the position of your body. Inner peace, attention, and concentration come with training. Everyone is capable of achieving this. Follow these steps to perform this exercise throughout the day:
1. Take a comfortable position and close your eyes.
2. Slowly inhale, imagining and feeling your body and its position in space.
3. Feel your breathing and its rhythm, the movement of air in your chest, and concentrate on breathing while remaining in a relaxed state.
4. Observe this process.
5. When a thought arises, focus on your breathing. Allow your thoughts to calmly leave, without internal irritation.
6. Remain in this state as long as you want.
7. Gradually return to your body and the room where you are by gently moving your arms and legs.
8. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes.
