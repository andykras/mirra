Body Relaxation and Self-Awareness

Creating a relaxed atmosphere is important for both exercises. Start by finding a quiet place where you won't be disturbed for 10-15 minutes. Open a window to let in fresh air, and play some relaxing music to help create a calming ambiance. There are many channels that offer various music for meditations. Here are some of them that we like:

Exercise 1: Body Relaxation
1. Preparation: Before beginning the exercise, find a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be disturbed for 10-15 minutes. Create a relaxing atmosphere by opening a window to let in fresh air and playing some soothing music. 
2. Breathing: Lie down comfortably and close your eyes. Breathe slowly and calmly, and focus on feeling the sensation of your breath. Say to yourself, "I feel my breathing." 
3. Relaxation: When your breathing is calm and even, start to relax different parts of your body. Concentrate on feeling each area of your body, imagining your consciousness in each part and feeling it relaxing. 
4. Forehead, Eyelids, Cheeks, Chin, and Jaw: Start by relaxing your forehead, eyelids, cheeks, chin, and jaw. Let go of any tension in these areas and allow them to become completely relaxed. 
5. Hairy Part of Head, Ears, and Neck Muscles: Move on to relaxing the hairy part of your head from your forehead to your neck, ears, and neck muscles. Let the relaxation flow down to your shoulders. 
6. Shoulders, Forearms, Elbows, and Back: Let your shoulders drop down, and relax the upper part of your forearms, elbows, and lower part of your forearms. Relax your back and muscles on each side of your spine as if sinking into a soft mattress. Exhale slowly to release tension in your back. 
7. Buttocks, Legs, and Fingers: Relax the muscles of your buttocks and legs, starting from the hips, then knees, ankles, and toes, all the way to the tips of your fingers. As you relax, feel the sensation of deeper and deeper relaxation. Free your mind from thoughts and feel the pleasant lightness. Imagine thoughts as waves around you that move away farther and farther, creating a calm and peaceful silence. 
8. Awareness: Be aware of your breathing and how it lulls you into a state of relaxation. Focus on good well-being and silence. Become slowly aware of the room you're in, your body, and its limbs. Gradually move your arms and legs. 
9. Ending: Take a few deep breaths and open your eyes. Imagine a calming light that envelops you and helps you relax. Take a break before "leaving" the exercise, and try not to let anything bother you during this exit. Remember that levels of consciousness are characterized by descent and slow ascent. If you're still having trouble, maintain your body position, close your eyes, and breathe slowly and evenly until you reach inner peace.

Exercise 2: Self-Awareness
1. Take a comfortable position and close your eyes.
2. Slowly inhale, imagining and feeling your body and its position in space.
3. Feel your breathing and its rhythm, the movement of air in the chest, and concentrate on breathing while remaining in a relaxed state.
4. Observe this process.
5. When a thought arises, focus on breathing. Allow thoughts to calmly leave, without internal irritation.
6. Remain in this state as long as you want.
7. Then gradually return to your body, to the room where you are, gently moving your arms and legs.
8. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes.

Remember to perform these exercises throughout the day. No matter how busy you are, you can think and act consciously, and be fully present in the moment. This makes your tasks and activities more interesting, and you can fulfill them more fully and joyfully. With practice, you can achieve inner peace, attention, and concentration, and become self-aware. By learning to listen to everything that happens inside, on the level of your thoughts and feelings, you can develop the art of living. So take some time for yourself and try these exercises today, and make them a part of your daily routine.
